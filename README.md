## 🌟 Overview

**Claudia** is a powerful desktop application that transforms how you interact with Claude Code. Built with Tauri 2, it provides a beautiful GUI for managing your Claude Code sessions, creating custom agents, tracking usage, and much more.

Think of Claudia as your command center for Claude Code - bridging the gap between the command-line tool and a visual experience that makes AI-assisted development more intuitive and productive.
