# Agents Module Refactoring - Phase 1 Complete

## Overview
This directory contains the refactored agents module, following clean code principles and improved error handling.

## Module Structure

```
agents/
├── mod.rs       - Main module with database init and core commands
├── error.rs     - Custom error types with thiserror
├── constants.rs - Pricing and configuration constants
├── types.rs     - Domain types and structs
├── helpers.rs   - Utility functions
├── execute.rs   - Agent execution logic
└── README.md    - This file
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Error Handling
- Custom `AgentError` enum with proper error variants
- Replaced `unwrap()` calls with `?` operator
- Better error context and messages

### 2. Constants
- Extracted all pricing constants
- Defined default values
- Centralized configuration

### 3. Type Safety
- Created enums for RunStatus and ModelType
- Added helper methods for pricing calculations
- Improved type definitions

### 4. Code Organization
- Separated concerns into modules
- Extracted helper functions
- Improved readability

## Migration Status

### Completed Functions
- `init_db` - Database initialization
- `list_agents` - List all agents
- `create_agent` - Create new agent
- `update_agent` - Update existing agent
- `delete_agent` - Delete agent
- `get_agent` - Get single agent
- `list_agent_runs` - List agent runs
- `execute_agent` - Execute agent (partial - needs ProcessRegistry integration)

### Pending Functions (Phase 2)
- Session management functions
- Import/export functions
- GitHub integration
- Scheduled runs
- Process monitoring
- Output streaming

## Known Issues

1. **ProcessRegistry Integration**: The current ProcessRegistry expects ownership of the Child process, but our refactored code needs to access stdout/stderr first. This needs a design change in Phase 2.

2. **Database Connections in Async Tasks**: We're opening new connections in spawned tasks instead of passing the state. This works but could be improved.

3. **Enum Usage**: We're still using String for status fields to maintain backward compatibility. Phase 2 will convert these to proper enums.

## Usage

The module is imported in `commands/mod.rs`:
```rust
pub mod agents;
```

And functions are available as:
```rust
use crate::commands::agents::{list_agents, create_agent, execute_agent};
```

## Next Steps

1. Complete function migration
2. Fix ProcessRegistry integration
3. Add proper tests
4. Convert status strings to enums
5. Improve async patterns
