## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Navigation**: Core documentation now accessible from root docs
2. **Reduced Duplication**: Consolidated related content into cohesive documents
3. **Better Organization**: Clear separation between current and archived docs
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Single source of truth for each topic
5. **Enhanced Discoverability**: Logical structure with clear naming

## Next Steps

1. Monitor for broken links and fix as needed
2. Update any CI/CD scripts that reference old documentation paths
3. Consider creating a documentation style guide
4. Add search functionality to documentation (future enhancement)

## Validation

All documentation has been reviewed to ensure:
- ✅ No broken internal links
- ✅ Consistent formatting
- ✅ Proper cross-references
- ✅ Clear navigation paths
- ✅ Archived documents preserved for history
