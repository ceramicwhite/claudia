# Refactoring Documentation

This section contains documentation about major refactoring efforts in the Claudia codebase.

## Overview

The refactoring documentation tracks significant code improvements, architectural changes, and modernization efforts. These documents serve as a historical record and guide for understanding how and why certain changes were made.

## Major Refactoring Efforts

### [Agent Module Refactoring Timeline](./AGENT_REFACTORING_TIMELINE.md)
A comprehensive timeline documenting the multi-phase refactoring of the agent module, including:
- Type safety improvements
- Error handling modernization
- Module reorganization
- Testing infrastructure updates
- Performance optimizations

## Refactoring Principles

Our refactoring efforts follow these key principles:

1. **Incremental Changes**: Break large refactorings into manageable phases
2. **Test Coverage**: Ensure comprehensive tests before and after changes
3. **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript and Rust's type systems
4. **Documentation**: Document decisions and migration paths
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Minimize breaking changes where possible

## Archive

Historical refactoring documents have been archived in `docs/archive/refactoring/`. The archive contains:
- Individual phase reports
- Validation checklists
- Metrics comparisons
- Detailed technical plans

These documents are preserved for reference but have been consolidated into the timeline documents for easier navigation.

## Future Refactoring

Planned refactoring efforts include:
- Frontend state management modernization
- Database query optimization
- Component library standardization
- API endpoint consolidation

## Contributing to Refactoring

When undertaking a refactoring:

1. **Plan**: Create a detailed plan with phases and goals
2. **Discuss**: Open an issue for community input
3. **Document**: Keep a record of changes and decisions
4. **Test**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage
5. **Migrate**: Provide clear migration guides
