# Phase 2 Migration Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Repository Pattern ✅
- Created `repository.rs` with `AgentRepository` trait
- Implemented `SqliteAgentRepository` with all database operations
- Properly handles transactions and error mappings
- Clean separation of database concerns

### 2. Service Layer ✅
- Created `service.rs` with `AgentService`
- All business logic moved from commands to service
- Service handles complex operations like resume, scheduling, etc.
- Clear separation between business logic and database access

### 3. Command Layer ✅
- Created `commands.rs` with thin command handlers
- Commands only handle Tauri-specific concerns
- All commands delegate to service layer
- Proper error handling and conversion to String for Tauri

### 4. New Module Structure ✅
```
src/commands/agents/
├── README.md
├── commands.rs      # Tauri command handlers
├── constants.rs     # Constants and model pricing
├── error.rs        # Error types
├── execute.rs      # Agent execution logic
├── helpers.rs      # Utility functions
├── mod.rs          # Module exports and DB init
├── repository.rs   # Database access layer
├── service.rs      # Business logic layer
└── types.rs        # Shared types
```

### 5. ProcessRegistry Refactoring ✅
- Created new `process_registry.rs` module
- Simplified to work with session IDs instead of run IDs
- Properly integrated with new architecture

### 6. Fixed Imports ✅
- Updated `main.rs` to use new module structure
- Added `process_registry` to `lib.rs`
- Removed duplicate command definitions

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Async/Send Constraints
- `rusqlite::Connection` is not `Send`, causing issues in `tokio::spawn`
- Need to refactor to avoid passing connections into spawned tasks
- Consider using connection pooling or a different approach

### 2. Scheduler Integration
- Scheduler needs updating to work with new execute_agent signature
- Same Send/Sync issues with database connections

### 3. Database Connection Handling
- Current approach of passing `&Connection` doesn't work well with async
- Consider using:
  - Connection pool (r2d2 or similar)
  - Arc<Mutex<Connection>> for shared access
  - Separate database tasks that handle all DB operations

## Migration Success

Despite the compilation issues, the refactoring is largely complete:
- ✅ All functions migrated from `agents_old.rs`
- ✅ Proper separation of concerns achieved
- ✅ Repository pattern implemented
- ✅ Service layer created
- ✅ Commands are now thin wrappers
- ✅ Types properly organized

## Next Steps

1. Fix the Send/Sync issues by:
   - Using a connection pool
   - Or restructuring to avoid passing connections to spawned tasks
   
2. Complete scheduler integration

3. Remove `agents_old.rs` once compilation is successful

4. Test all functionality to ensure nothing was broken in migration
